# Demo Next.js Google Places

This project demonstrates the difference between the Google APIs' simple textSearch and the combination of textSearch and nearbySearch.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to showcase the discrepancy between the simple textSearch and the combination of textSearch and nearbySearch functionalities provided by Google Places API.

### Simple textSearch

When using the simple textSearch functionality, if searching by address instead of the place name for example, it would find only one place related to the street, possibly neglecting other establishments at the same address.

### Combination of textSearch and nearbySearch

In contrast, combining textSearch and nearbySearch can yield more comprehensive results. It can locate all the places with the same address, offering a broader range of options compared to simple textSearch, making the search by address effective, compared to the search by textSearch only.
